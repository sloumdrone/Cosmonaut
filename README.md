# Cosmonaut

A SHMUP for the terminal! 


## Design and Implementation

Cosmonaut is written in Python 2.7. This was a deliberate choice due to its ubiquity on modern Apple OSX systems (among many others). Cosmonaut only utilizes the Python standard library so that it can be acquired and run by many systems without installing dependencies (shell script "installer" for moving it to the path coming soon).

## Gameplay

At present, gameplay is basic SHMUP territory: Move around and shoot the things that are shooting at you!
